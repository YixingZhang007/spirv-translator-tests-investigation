# SPIR-V Translation Test Discrepancy Analysis

This repository documents an investigation into SYCL test cases that **pass with the [SPIRV-LLVM-Translator](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM-Translator)** but **fail with the [SPIR-V Backend](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)**.

The focus is specifically on tests from the [intel/llvm SYCL end-to-end test suite](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/sycl/sycl/test-e2e).
